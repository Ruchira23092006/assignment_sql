    "ANS 1: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, \n",
    "and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and querying \n",
    "of information. Databases are widely used in various applications and systems to \n",
    "store and handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that\n",
    "differ in their data models, query languages, and overall design philosophies:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational \n",
    "data model. They store data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. \n",
    "The relationships between tables are defined using keys, such as primary keys and \n",
    "foreign keys. SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and\n",
    "manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases provide several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "Well-defined schemas that enforce data consistency.\n",
    "ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data\n",
    "integrity and transaction support.\n",
    "Suitable for complex queries and data relationships.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, \n",
    "and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases use various data models and \n",
    "structures other than the traditional relational model. They are designed to \n",
    "handle large volumes of rapidly changing, unstructured, or semi-structured data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases offer flexibility, scalability, and high performance for certain \n",
    "use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases can be categorized into different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document databases: Store and retrieve semi-structured data in documents, typically in JSON or XML formats. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.\n",
    "Key-value stores: Use a simple key-value data model for rapid data retrieval. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "Columnar databases: Organize data into columns instead of rows for efficient data compression and analytic queries. Examples include Apache Cassandra and Apache HBase.\n",
    "Graph databases: Store and retrieve data based on graph structures, with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.\n",
    "NoSQL databases provide the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema that allows for agile development and schema evolution.\n",
    "Horizontal scalability and distributed architecture to handle large-scale data.\n",
    "High performance for certain types of queries, especially those involving large datasets.\n",
    "Both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between\n",
    "them depends on the specific requirements of an application or system. Some applications\n",
    "may even use a combination of both types, known as polyglot persistence, to leverage the\n",
    "benefits of each database for different aspects of the data storage and retrieval needs."

    "\n",

    "DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve data from a database. DQL statements are primarily focused on querying and retrieving data from tables based on specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT. It allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables and specify the criteria for selecting specific rows or columns. Here's an explanation and an example of the SELECT statement:\n",

    "SELECT: The SELECT statement is used to query data from one or more tables. \n",

    "This query will return a result set containing the \"Name\" and \"Salary\" columns for all\n",
    "rows in the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT Name, Salary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Salary > 50000;\n",

    "Ans 5: Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a combination of columns in a database \n",

    "integrity of data within the table. Here are some key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two rows can have\n",
    "the same value for the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-nullability: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values. It must have a \n",
    "value for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unchangeability: The values of the primary key should remain constant once they are \n",
    "assigned to a row. Changing the primary key value would break referential integrity \n",
    "and data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single value or combination: A primary key can be a single column or a combination \n",
    "of multiple columns, known as a composite primary key. Composite primary keys are \n",
    "useful when a single column cannot uniquely identify each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and create relationships between tables.\n",
    "They provide a unique identifier for each row, which helps in indexing, data retrieval,\n",

    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that\n",
    "establishes a link or relationship between that table and another table. It refers to\n",
    "the primary key column(s) of another table and represents a connection between the two \n",
    "tables. Key points about foreign keys are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship: A foreign key represents a relationship between tables, where it refers \n",
    "to the primary key of another table, known as the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Integrity: Foreign keys maintain referential integrity by ensuring that \n",
    "values in the foreign key column(s) of one table match the values in the primary key \n",
    "column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Consistency: Foreign keys help enforce data consistency by preventing the insertion\n",
    "of invalid or nonexistent data into the referencing table. The foreign key constraint \n",
    "ensures that any value in the foreign key column must exist in the referenced table's \n",
    "primary key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys are commonly used to establish relationships, such as one-to-one, \n",
    "one-to-many, or many-to-many, between tables. They enable data integrity, provide \n",
    "structural integrity, and enforce the rules defined by the relationships between tables.\n",

    "fetchall() method retrieves all rows of the result set from the last executed query.\n",
    "The fetched data is processed using a loop (in this case, printed to the console).\n",
    "Finally, the close() method is called on both the cursor and the connection objects to \n",

    "HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the grouped rows based on conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT clause specifies the columns that will be retrieved from the tables.\n",
    "It determines the data elements that will be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "DISTINCT: The DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set.\n",
    "It ensures that each row in the result set is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on specified columns.\n",

    "LIMIT/OFFSET: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used for pagination or limiting the number\n",
